Affymetrix exon array data on breast cancer cell lines generated by
the Joe Gray Lab at LNBL.  Data were described and published in
conjunction with Heiser, et al. 2012.

Gene expression was assessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene
1.0 ST exon array platform. Gene-level summaries of expression were
computed using aroma.affymetrix (Bengtsson, et al. 2009) with quantile
normalization and a log-additive probe-level model (PLM) based on the
HuEx-1_0-st-v2,DCCg,Spring2008 CDF.  The raw data are available in
ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-181).

The data is a tab-delimited text file that contains gene-level
summaries across breast cancer cell lines.  Each column represents
data from one cell line, each row represents gene expression (log2
transformed) for a single gene.  Gene identifiers are HGNC gene
symbols.
